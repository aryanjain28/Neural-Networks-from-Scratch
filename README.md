# Chapter-5: Calculating Network Error with Loss

-> This chapter talks about the loss functions and "why" we need it. <br />
-> More specifically we implement and understand the "Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss Function" and how it is different from other loss functions.<br />
-> Basically, Categorical Cross Entropy loss function is used when our model predicts probabilities.<br />
-> The chapter also clearly describes Log function and why it is very important in the field of ML.<br />
-> New terms like "Dead Node" and "Explosing Values" are also described and how can we overcome this problem. <br />

At last we merge out loss function to the already existing code.
