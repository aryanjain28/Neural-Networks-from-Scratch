# Neural Networks from Scratch

This project is highly motivated from a book named, "Neural Network from Scratch" by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukie≈Ça.<br/>
In this project, I have implemented the "math" behind various building blocks of a Neural Network, like - Activation Functions, Layers, Loss Functions, etc.<br/>

This project helped me with a deeper understanding of Neural Networks and how things "really" work inside a neural network.<br/>
I highly recommend this book, please checkout here: <a href="https://nnfs.io/">https://nnfs.io/</a><br/>

P.S. I have discussed the different chapters of the book in the different branches. <br/>
Cheers!<br/>
