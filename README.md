# Neural-Networks-from-Scratch

This project is highly motivated from a book named, "Neural Network from Scratch" by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukie≈Ça. 
The project describes the "maths" of various fundamentals of a Neural Network, like - Activation Functions, Dense Layer, Loss Function.

The project helped me with a deeper understanding of Neural Networks.
I highly recommend this book, please checkout here: <a href="https://nnfs.io/">https://nnfs.io/</a>

P.S. I have discussed the different chapters of the book in the different branches.
