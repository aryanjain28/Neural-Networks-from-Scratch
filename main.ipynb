    "In the above code, we have three sets of weights and three biases, which define three neurons. Each neuron is “connected” to the same inputs. The difference is in the separate weights and bias that each neuron applies to the input. This is called a fully connected neural network — every neuron in the current layer has connections to every neuron from the previous layer. This is a very common type of neural network, but it should be noted that there is no requirement to fully connect everything like this. At this point, we have only shown code for a single layer with very few neurons. Imagine coding many more layers and more neurons. This would get very challenging to code using our current methods. Instead, we could use a loop to scale and handle dynamically-sized inputs and layers. We’ve turned the separate weight variables into a list of weights so we can iterate over them, and we changed the code to use loops instead of the hardcoded operations."
